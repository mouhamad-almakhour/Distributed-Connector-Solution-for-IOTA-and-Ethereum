# Distributed Connector Solution for IOTA and Ethereum

## Overview

This project defines and implements a distributed connector solution that intermediates between the IOTA and Ethereum blockchains. The primary goal is to facilitate the storage of Tangle transactions made by IoT sensors into Solidity smart contracts, ensuring data sustainability, availability, and enhanced scalability.

## Main Duties Performed

- **Distributed Connector Solution**: 
  - Defined and implemented a system that serves as an intermediary between IOTA and Ethereum, allowing seamless integration of Tangle transactions into the Ethereum blockchain.

- **Event Tracking System**: 
  - Developed an event system that monitors and tracks all data exchanges between IOTA and Solidity contracts, ensuring comprehensive logging and transparency.

- **Technology Stack**:
  - Utilized a diverse range of technologies for the development of the connector software:
    - **JavaScript** for application logic and web functionalities.
    - **Web3.js** for interacting with Ethereum blockchain.
    - **Solidity** for developing smart contracts on Ethereum.
    - **Tangle** technology for leveraging IOTA's unique distributed ledger.
    - **ZeroMQ** for efficient messaging and communication between components.

## Objectives

- Achieve **storage independence** from any single blockchain infrastructure.
- Enhance **scalability** to accommodate increasing data demands from IoT sensors.
- Provide **data sustainability** and **availability** for critical transaction information.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Access to an Ethereum node (can be a local Ganache instance or a remote node)
- IOTA node for Tangle integration

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure your settings (if necessary), such as Ethereum node URLs.

### Installation
Run the connector software using Node.js:
  ```bash
node send_device_data_IOTA.js
```
Make sure the IOTA and Ethereum environments are correctly set up for the connector to work effectively.
